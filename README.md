# Cryptocurrencies

In this challenge our fictional client, Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. However, they are having trouble making sense of all of the cryptocurrencies on the market. The objective of this analysis is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped so that Accountability Accounting can create a classification system for this new investment.

This Jupyter notebook visualizes clusters for several cryptocurrencies that are created using a K-means unsupervised learning algorithm with scaling and PCA.
